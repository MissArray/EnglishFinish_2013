## The 2013 version of the website I created while freelancing as a copy-editor

*English Finish* is the website I first created from scratch in 2006, while freelancing as a copy-editor. Learning web development was not an option due to time constraints, but I was intrigued by the possibility of designing and building a website from zero; using templates wasn't an option either, because I wanted it to look unique, as I envisaged in mock-ups.

The compromise between getting a functioning website up and running fast, to attract clients, and creating it myself, without prior knowledge of coding was to use an open-source WYSIWYG editor called Kompozer (now no longer supported) and the resources that the then still youngish internet made available to aspiring web designers and developers.

The first, 2006 version of the English Finish website consisted of a single webpage, but it did the job. In 2011, I decided that my website needed more pages and a new look, so I redesigned everything, including all graphics, and used the same resources, i.e. Kompozer and online tutorials, to overhaul it. 

In 2013 I updated the content and the layout; unfortunately (or fortunately) my editorial workload did not allow me to turn it into a responsive website, even though devices with smaller screens were on the rise. In 2018 I stopped copy-editing to learn coding the proper way, so this entire repository is a (still functional on large screens) relic from my pre-coding days and can be accessed at
